# Extra D codes

lcg_comparison_d - check which type of LCG counting is faster. Tested versions: {build-in engine (range), struct, class, scope class, final class}. Struct and final class showed the best performance.

ordered_aa.d - example from D forum of OrderedAA implementation

ikod_hashmap.d - example with ordereddict where ikod.HashMap is used instead of build-in AA

d_ordereddict.d - realization of OrderedDict data structure.

d_array{2}.d - the version for small LRU cache size, based on @ssvb suggestion from D forum.
