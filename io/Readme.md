# IO benchmark for different languages

The ideo of benchmark generally in comparison of I/O speed performance with stdio/stdout of large amount of data for popular programming languages, usually or potentially used in competitive programming.

There are two synthetic problems:
* Part A: just read from stdin and out to stdout. Really artificial problem just to compare different techniques of printing.

* Part B: more real problem. T arrays. In each array N_t elements. To solve the problem the program should print all mean values of each array.

For benchmarking of languages and different approaches it is possible to use two tags: "simple" and "hack".
Tag "simple" means, that used standard approaches widely known and popular.
Tag "hacK" should be used if the solution based on non-standard and tricky hacks non idiomatic for language.

## Details

Into main table with results added only best solution of each type for each language. Language specific details located in language directories.
