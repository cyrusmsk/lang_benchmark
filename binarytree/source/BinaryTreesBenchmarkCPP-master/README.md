[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/binarytrees/binarytreesbenchmarkcpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/binarytrees/binarytreesbenchmarkcpp)

This is a C++ port of my D port of my [Free Pascal](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/binarytrees-fpascal-7.html) "Binary Trees" benchmark implementation, written out of curiosity to see how they compare.

Recommended command line for building and running this:

```
make build
time ./binarytrees 21
```
